<p>Bloodborne is an action on PS4 where you play as a hunter in a place called yharnam, one of the first bosses you fight is the Cleric Beast. The Cleric Beast is hard challenge for first time players, the boss move fast and it's attacks can do a lot of damage to players at a low level.what most people don't know is that the Cleric Beast is a optional boss people do not have to fight it but people seem to always run into it. </p>
<p2>A boss that people will fight later in the game is vicar amelia, Amelia is a beast with white fur. most players that have made it to Vicar Amelia find that when she is below half health she will start trying to heal herself if players don't stop this she can heal herself back to full health making the fight harder bcause she will can keep the attacks she gets when she was lower on health.</p2>
